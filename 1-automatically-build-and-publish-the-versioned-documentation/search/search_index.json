The Spyderisk System Modeller is a generic risk assessment tool and must be configured with a model of a domain (\"knowledgebase\"), containing the available asset types and relations, descriptions of the threats, the possible security controls, and more. The software comes bundled with a knowledgebase for complex networked information systems.</p> <p>The web-based graphical user interface guides the user through the following steps:</p> <ol> <li>The user draws a model of their system model by dragging and dropping typed assets linked by typed relations onto a canvas.</li> <li>The software analyses the model, inferring network paths, data flows, client-service trust relationships and much more (depending on the knowledgebase).</li> <li>The software analyses the model to find all the threats and potential controls that are encoded in the knowledgebase. The threats are automatically chained together via their consequences to create long-reaching and inter-linked attack graphs and secondary threat cascades through the system.</li> <li>The user assigns impact levels to various failure modes on the primary assets only.</li> <li>The user can add controls to the model to reduce the likelihood of threats.</li> <li>The software does a risk analysis, considering the external environment, the defined impact levels, the controls, and the chains of threats that have been discovered. The threats and consequences may then be ranked by their risk, highlighting the most important problems.</li> <li>The user can choose to add or change the controls (back to step 5), to redesign the system (step 1), or to accept the system design.</li> <li>The software can output reports describing the system along with the threats, consequences and their risk levels.</li> </ol> <p>The knowledgebase describes threats through patterns of multiple assets along with their context (such as network or physical location), rather than assuming that threats relate to a single asset type. Similarly, methods to reduce threat likelihood (\"control strategies\") may comprise multiple controls on different assets (for example, both an X509 certificate at a service and verification of the certificate at the client). Knowledgebases may also be designed such that control strategies help solve one problem but exacerbate another (for example, adding a password reduces the likelihood of unauthorised access to a service but increases the likelihood of the legitimate user failing to get in). All this provides a high degree of realism to the analysis.</p> <p>With a compatible knowledgebase, the software can perform a both long-term risk assessment suitable for when designing a system, and an operational (or \"runtime\") risk assessment using a short time horizon. Different controls are appropriate in each case (for instance, implementing a new staff security training policy does not help with an ongoing attack, but blocking a network path does). For the operational risk assessment, the state of the system model must first be synchronised with the current operational state (for instance through integration via the API with OpenVAS or a SIEM).</p> <p>Development of the software began in 2013, drawing on research dating back to 2008. It was open-sourced in early 2023. The research and development up to the point of open sourcing was done solely by the University of Southampton IT Innovation Centre in a variety of UK and EU research projects.</p>"},{"location":"Reference%20Guide/","title":"Reference Guide","text":"<p>Entries can be accessed by clicking the ? icon at any time.</p>"},{"location":"Reference%20Guide/#asset-palette","title":"Asset Palette","text":"<p>Lists the available assets (the \u2018objects\u2019 in your system) that can be drag-andn-dropped onto the modelling canvas as nodes in your network.

SSM allows you to model your current system and identify cybersecurity and compliance risks and the appropriate mitigations. It also allows you to model the reduction in risk resulting from the mitigations you will introduce in the future. In the same way, you can also model future changes to your system (e.g. adding a new cloud server, new database, new software applications, new sensors to a factory line, new staff, etc, to your system) and analyse how your cybersecurity and compliance risks will be changed as a result of that addition and what new mitigations you may need to implement.

ISO27005 describes an asset as \"anything that has value to an organisation and which therefore requires protection\" - these valuable assets are known as Primary Assets. So, the first stage of using SSM is to construct the model of your system by placing assets (e.g. servers, data, people, buildings\u2026etc) onto the modelling canvas and creating links (relationships) between them. It will also be necessary to model many of the Supporting Assets as well. A simple, partially completed model can be seen below.</p> <p></p> <p>Next the model is automatically validated by SSM. The result of the validation is that any modelling errors will be identified and detaled information is provided to correct those errors. The Possible Modelling Errors panel can be seen below.</p> <p></p> <p>ISO27005 states that \u201cAsset identification should be performed at a suitable level of detail that provides sufficient information for the risk assessment\u201d. So the final part of Risk Identification is to adjust the model to accurately represent your system by adding in the existing cybersecurity controls that you already have in place. Existing controls can be described in the model with the Control class, using the 'in place' attribute. Control types in our model include physical security (locks on doors), organisational measures (staff screening, training, policies), service security (TLS, AuthN, passwords, etc), data security, resource management and more. One or more Controls combine to form a Control Strategy. In addition, you should also tweak the Trustworthiness and Consequences/Impact levels for each asset to felect your specific business (or other) context. The Trustworthiness and Consequence/Impact levels for the Administrator asset can be seen below.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Tutorials/1%20Overview/#risk-analysis","title":"Risk Analysis","text":"<p>Once your system has been modelled with sufficient detail, the next phase is to analyse the risk to your system. The Network Knowledgebase underpinning SSM contains a catalogue of generic threats along with the information necessary to identify when and where each type of threat is present in the System Model. In this way, SSM automates the process by finding threats and calculating risk levels. It also provides considerable information to support the second and third of these steps (Risk Analysis and Risk Evaluation). SSM enables you to see and understand the relationships between assets and threats as well as comprehend the Consequences to your system by knowing the Likelihood and Impact levels associated with all threats. SSM will also enable you to identify and understand any GDPR compliance issues, and their consequences, that you may have concerning the data flows within your system.

SSM allows you to easily apply those controls, re-run the risk assessment, re-model if required, and clearly visualise the effect on the Consequences (Likelihood and Impact levels) of each threat and its associated control(s).

The relationships between these concepts are summarised in the diagram below:</p> <p></p> <p>In accordance with ISO 27005 standards, the SSM tool models assets in terms of Trustworthiness, Threats, Consequences, Impact and Controls. The Trustworthiness of an asset is how much that asset can be relied upon to function correctly. Each asset is automatically assigned a various Trustworthiness levels and at this stage there is no need to change the default settings.</p> <p>SSM also automatically identifies the Primary and Secondary Threats and their Consequences in relation to an individual asset. Threats cause Consequences at Assets which themselves almost always undermine a Trustworthiness Attribute at the Asset. A Secondary Threat is the inevitable consequence of another Threat (so loss of availability of a host would inevitably cause loss of availability of any data it stored) and so is directly \"caused by\" a Consequence. A Primary Threat is an event (accidental, or more often deliberate) and made more likely by a lowered Trustworthiness Attribute. In this way a complex interlinked chain of Threat-Consequence-Threat is modelled demonstrating how an attacker (or just accidental or inevitable problems) propagate through the system.</p> <p>Next, if a Threat and its Consequences happen, there will be a negative Impact on your business of varying degree. Consequently, SSM will automatically assign a default Impact Level for each asset in your model.</p> <p>SSM will also recommend a range of security Controls to mitigate against the threats identified.</p> <p>The Consequences of a Threat will also have an Impact on your business. In this example, losing customer data is likely to negatively impact your business in important ways, for example, through the loss of reputation and therefore the loss of future (and existing) customers. As a result, SSM will suggest a range of security measures, known as Controls, that you can implement to reduce the likelihood or even block the Threats from occuring. In some cases though, the introduction of a Control can also trigger another Threat. For example, introducing password protection on the customer data introduces the Threat that the Sales Manager may forget her password, with the Consequence that she may suffer a Loss of Availability of that data (and any potential secondary threats that may cause).</p> <p>In short, SSM conceptualises cyersecurity risk in the following way:</p> <ul> <li>Assets have a set of Trustworthiness ratings (how reliable they are in various ways), but can also be subject to Threats (Primary or Secondary)</li> <li>Threats have Consequences (and Consequences can also cause more Threats)</li> <li>Consequences have a negative Impact on a business of varying degrees (very low to very high)</li> <li>Threats can be mitigated by implementing security Controls (but some controls can cause more Threats and Consequences)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Tutorials/5%20Risk%20Analysis%20-%20Impact%20and%20Controls/#setting-impact-levels","title":"Setting Impact Levels","text":"<p>Although SSM simplifies and speeds up the risk analysis process by automatically assigning default Trustworthiness and Impact levels to the assets in your model, in accordance with ISO 27005 standards, you should nevertheless identify the Primary assets in your model: critical data and critical business processes. some of your Data assets may be critical to the business and the Impact levels for the various Consequences on those data assets should be carefully chosen. The software does not model business processes but often these are best represented by an Application Process. Again, the critical ones should be examined carefully and their Impact levels set.</p> <p>The other assets in the model will (most probably) have the correct default settings. It is not necessary to consider knock-on effects as this is done automatically. For instance, if the availability of a dataset is critical to your business then the Impact level for \"Loss of Availability\" on that data asset should be elevated. It is not necessary though to elevate the \"Loss of Availability\" Impact level of the Host that hosts the data as this will automatically be taken into account.</p> <p>To set the Impact Levels for a Data asset you will need to click on the asset in the model and then choose the Impact Level for each Consequence.

When conducting the risk analysis, the SSM tool will automatically consider all these core concepts, along with one further important aspect: Likelihood Likelihood refers to the probability of a certain Threat occurring - some Threats are more common (or more 'likely') than others, and the configuration of your system can increase or decrease the Likelihood Level for any individual Threat. For example, the existing security Controls you added to the model in the previous step will help to reduce the Likelihood of a Threat occurring (while their absence will increase the Likelihood).</p> <p>SSM calculates risk through a combination of the Impact of a Threat and its Consequences and the Likelihood of that Threat occurring. For example, a High Impact Consequence and a High Likelihood Threat will result in a Very High risk to your system:</p> <p></p> <p>NOTE: This is why it is very important to set your Impact levels and existing Controls correctly during the model validation stage \u2013 otherwise the risk calculations will be less accurate for your specific system in its business context.</p> <p>SSM will automatically calculate the risk of Consequences for every asset in your model (it will also suggest security Controls to mitigate against those risks).

A Control may be part of many Control Strategies. A Control Strategy may address many Threats.</p> <p></p> <p>The Control Strategies tab will display all the recommended Controls that should be applied to reduce the likelihood of the Threat. A description of the Control is provided, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of that Control.</p> <p>Once you have understood the Control, you can use the same traffic light system that we have seen before in order to add the recommended Control(s) to your system.

To discover the effect of introducing a Control (or Control Strategies) to your system select the orange light and run the Risk Analysis again in the same way. You will then be able to observe the difference the Control makes to the Likelihood and Risk levels.</p> <p>In our example system, we will address the highest risk Threat of Remote Access via the Router by implementing the Control of SecureHostConfig to ensure the Router is securely configured.
